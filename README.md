# Third Year Project

## RISC-V RV32i Processor Core

This is a single core RISC-V base 32-bit ISA compliant processor which implements a 5-Stage pipeline with dynamic branch prediction in the form of a saturating counter and the appropriate hazard control logic.
This was created for my third year project at the University of Manchester.
